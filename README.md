# Perichron

A simple storage interface layer that Astra uses as an intermediary to read 
and write storage values. 

Eventually our goal is to build this into a custom back-end
package for all of our resources that allows them to share data and talk to each other across a network of user's devices. 

### Installation
You can find Perichron on pub.dev [here](https://pub.dev/packages/perichron). 

To add in the command line, use: 
```
flutter pub add perichron
```
